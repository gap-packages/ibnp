<Heading>Introduction</Heading>

The &IBNP; package provides methods for computing an involutive (&Grob;)
basis <M>B</M> for an ideal <M>J</M> over a polynomial ring 
<M>\mathcal{R}</M> in both the commutative and noncommutative cases.
Secondly, methods are provided to involutively reduce a given polynomial
to its normal form in <M>\mathcal{R}/J</M>.
<P/>
This package was first submitted to run with &GAP; 4.13.1. 
<P/> 

The package is loaded with the command
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage( "ibnp" ); 
]]>
</Example>
<P/>

The package may be obtained either as a compressed <Code>.tar</Code> file 
or as a <Code>.zip</Code> file, <File>ibnp-version_number.tar.gz</File>,
by ftp from one of the following sites: 
<List>
<Item>
the &IBNP; GitHub release site: 
<URL>https://gap-packages.github.io/ibnp/</URL>. 
</Item>
<Item>
any &GAP; archive, e.g. 
<URL>https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html</URL>; 
</Item>
</List> 
<Index>GitHub repository</Index> 
The package also has a GitHub repository at: 
<URL>https://github.com/gap-packages/ibnp</URL>. 
<P/> 


Once the package is loaded, the manual <Code>doc/manual.pdf</Code> 
can be found in the documentation folder. 
The <Code>html</Code> versions, with or without MathJax, 
may be rebuilt as follows: 
<P/>
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> ReadPackage( "ibnp", "makedoc.g" ); 
]]>
</Example>
<P/>
It is possible to check that the package has been installed correctly
by running the test files (this terminates the &GAP; session): 
<P/>
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> ReadPackage( "ibnp", "tst/testall.g" );
