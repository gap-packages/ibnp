<Heading>Using the packages <Package>GBNP</Package>
and <Package>NMO</Package></Heading>

This package deals with polynomials in noncommutative algebras
and to do so makes use of the noncommutative polynomial operations 
provided by the <Package>GBNP</Package> <Cite Key='GBNP'/> package,
and orderings provided by the <Package>NMO</Package> package,
which is now included within <Package>GBNP</Package>.
In this chapter we remind users how to call some of these operations.


<Section Label="sec-nps">
<Heading>Noncommutative polynomials (NPs)</Heading>

Recall that the main datatype used by the &GBNP; package is a list 
of noncommutative polynomials (NPs). 
The data type for a noncommutative polynomial (its NP format)
is a list of two lists:
<List>
<Item>
The first is a list <M>m</M> of monomials.
</Item>
<Item>
The second is a list <M>c</M> of coefficients of these monomials.
</Item>
</List>
The two lists have the same length. 
The polynomial represented by the ordered pair <M>[m,c]</M> is 
<M>\sum_i c_i m_i</M>.
A monomial is a list of positive integers.
They are interpreted as the indices of the variables. 
So, if <M>k = [1,3,2,2,1]</M> and the variables are <M>x,y,z</M> 
(in this order), then <M>k</M> represents the monomial <M>xzy^2x</M>. 
There are various ways to print these, 
but the default uses variables <M>a,b,c,\ldots</M>.
The zero polynomial is represented by <C>[[],[]]</C> and
the polynomial <M>1</M> is represented by <C>[[[]],[1]]</C>. 
The algorithms are applicable for the algebra 
<M>\mathbb{F}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_t]</M>
of noncommutative polynomials in <A>t</A> variables 
over the field <M>\mathbb{F}</M>.
Accordingly, the list <M>c</M> should contain elements of 
<M>\mathbb F</M>.
<P/>
<Index>NP2GP</Index> <Index>GP2NP</Index>
The &GBNP; functions <C>GP2NP</C> and <C>NP2GP</C> 
convert a polynomial to NP format and back again.
Polynomials returned by <C>NP2GP</C> print with their coefficients
enclosed in brackets.
Polynomials may also be printed using the function <C>PrintNP</C>. 
The function PrintNPList is used to print a list of NPs,
with one polynomial per line.
The function <C>CleanNP</C> is used to collect terms and reorder them. 
The default ordering is first by degree and then lexicographically - <C>MonomialGrlexOrdering</C>.
Alternative orderings are available - 
see section <Ref Sect="sec-orderings"/>.

<Section Label="sec-grob">
<Heading>&Grob; Bases</Heading>

The &GBNP; package computes &Grob; bases using the function <C>SGrobner</C>.
In the example below the polynomials <M>\{p,q\}</M> define an ideal in 
<M>\mathbb{Z}[a,b]</M> which has a three element &Grob; basis.
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> p := [ [ [2,2,2], [2,1], [1,2] ], [1,3,-1] ];;
gap> q := [ [ [1,1], [2] ], [1,1] ];; 
gap> PrintNPList( [p,q] );
 b^3 + 3ba - ab
 a^2 + b 
gap> GB := SGrobner( [p,q] );;
gap> PrintNPList(GB);
 a^2 + b 
 ba - ab 
 b^3 + 2ab

<Section Label="sec-orderings">
<Heading>Orderings for monomials</Heading>

The three monomial orderings provided by the main &GAP; library are
<C>MonomialLexOrdering</C>, <C>MonomialGrlexOrdering</C>
and <C>MonomialGrevlexOrdering</C>.
The first of these is the default used by <Package>GBNP</Package>.
<P/>
The <Package>NMO</Package> package is now part of the package 
<Package>GBNP</Package>.
It provides a choice of orderings on monomials, including 
lexicographic and length-lexicographic ones.
